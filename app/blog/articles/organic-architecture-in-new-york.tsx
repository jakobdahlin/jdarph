          Organic architecture is a design approach that prioritizes harmony between built structures and their natural
          surroundings. It emphasizes fluid, interconnected forms inspired by nature, utilizing sustainable materials
          and integrating buildings seamlessly into their environments. By blurring the lines between indoor and outdoor
          spaces, organic architecture enhances both aesthetic appeal and environmental sustainability, fostering a
          sense of unity and balance within the built environment.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">Frank Lloyd Wright's Influence</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Frank Lloyd Wright, often regarded as the father of organic architecture, played a pivotal role in shaping
          this design philosophy. His innovative approach to architecture emphasized harmony with nature and organic
          integration of buildings into their surroundings.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">How Wright's Principles Shaped Organic Architecture</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Wright's principles, including his belief in sympathetic architecture and his keen observation of natural
          patterns, profoundly influenced the development of organic architecture. His designs sought to create spaces
          that felt connected to the environment, blurring the boundaries between indoors and outdoors.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">Brief History of Organic Architecture in the Broader Context</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Organic architecture emerged as a response to the industrialization and urbanization of the late 19th and
          early 20th centuries. Architects sought to move away from the rigid, mechanistic forms of traditional
          architecture and embrace a more holistic approach that celebrated the beauty and resilience of nature. While
          Wright's work in the early 20th century laid the foundation for organic architecture, the philosophy has since
          evolved and been adopted by architects around the world.

        <p className="mb-4">
          Organic architecture in New York City has a rich historical perspective, shaped by key figures and significant
          developments over the years. The movement gained momentum in the early 20th century, notably influenced by the
          groundbreaking work of Frank Lloyd Wright. Wright's visionary designs, such as the Solomon R. Guggenheim
          Museum completed in 1959, challenged traditional architectural norms and paved the way for a new era of
          organic design in the city.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Throughout the mid-20th century, organic architecture continued to evolve, with notable projects like the TWA
          Flight Center at JFK Airport, designed by Eero Saarinen in 1962, showcasing innovative forms that embraced the
          natural landscape. However, it wasn't until the turn of the 21st century that organic architecture truly
          flourished in New York City.
