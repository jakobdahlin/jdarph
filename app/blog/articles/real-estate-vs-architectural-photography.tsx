      <p className="text-lg mb-8">
        At first glance, these two may appear similar, but they serve different purposes and require unique approaches.
        I believe that knowing the difference can serve as a valuable tool for real estate and architecture
        professionals alike. Therefore, I want to shed light on the key differences between real estate vs.
        architectural photography. I'll also share some of my experiences, preferred equipment and shooting techniques.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">The art of visual storytelling</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Real estate photography is a specialized field within photography that focuses on capturing properties in a
          way that makes them appealing to potential buyers or renters. The key purpose is to showcase the property's
          best features, making it look inviting and desirable. It's about creating a visual narrative that helps
          potential buyers imagine themselves living in that space.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">Essential equipment</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The importance of having the right equipment in real estate photography cannot be overstated. A wide-angle
          lens, for instance, is crucial for capturing spaciousness in rooms. Using a tripod should go without saying,
          but it is important as it ensures consistency. Personally, I encourage working with the natural light, but
          using a flash can help illuminate darker spaces.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">Shooting techniques</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Shooting techniques also play a significant role. From choosing the right angles to capturing the best natural
          light, these techniques can make a substantial difference in the final images. Let's not forget about
          post-processing. Editing is a very important part of real estate photography, involving correction of any
          distortions, lighting enhancement, and making sure the photos are as appealing as possible.

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">Beauty and design</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Architectural photography, on the other hand, is about capturing the beauty and design aspects of buildings.
          It's not about selling a property, but rather about showcasing the architectural and aesthetic appeal of a
          building. Architects, interior designers, and builders often use architectural photography to display their
          work.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">The art and science of architectural photography</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          This field of photography is both an art and a science. On the artistic side, it's about capturing a building
          in a way that evokes emotion, tells a story, or conveys a certain aesthetic. On the technical side, it
          involves understanding how light interacts with different materials, capturing the right angles and
          perspectives, and showcasing the building's design in the best possible way.
        </p>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-medium mb-2">Equipment and techniques</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          In architectural photography, the equipment and techniques used can vary significantly from those used in real
          estate photography. For instance, while a wide-angle lens is essential in real estate photography,
          architectural photographers might use a variety of lenses to capture different aspects of a building.
          Similarly, while real estate photographers often aim to make a space look as large and inviting as possible,
          architectural photographers might focus more on capturing a building's unique design elements, even if that
          means highlighting smaller, more intimate spaces.

            <p>
              In my career working in real estate, I've had the privilege of working at many historic Manhattan gems
              like the Woolworth Building and The Helmsley Building, as well as brand-new developments. The contrast is
              fascinating. With older buildings, there's a sense of history and character that's deeply ingrained in
              every brick and beam. These structures have unique architectural details that tell a story of a different
              era.

            <p>
              My work in architectural photography often involves documentation, like the renovation of the Textile
              Building. It's a very exciting experience to photograph an old building as it's repurposed for modern use.
              One aspect I cherish the most is the opportunity to witness and capture a place in its original state even
              if some of the original design is kept alive.

              What's the most challenging aspect of real estate photography, and how do you overcome it?
            </h3>
            <p>
              The most challenging aspect is often making smaller spaces appear larger and more inviting. I overcome
              this by using a wide-angle lens and shooting from corners to maximize the sense of the space. Whenever I
              encounter a relatively large space, my architectural instincts sometimes draw me towards a more
              symmetrical straight-on angle. I refer to this type of image as a 'statement-shot' – a powerful tool in
              attracting listing viewers and an effective strategy from a marketing perspective.

              How do you decide which features to highlight in a property when doing real estate photography?
            </h3>
            <p>
              I usually focus on the unique selling points of the property. This could be a spacious kitchen, a
              beautiful view, or a unique architectural feature. I also ensure to capture the overall layout to give
              potential buyers/renters a sense of the space.

            </h3>
            <p>
              The most rewarding aspect in real estate vs. architectural photography is capturing the unique narratives
              each field offers. In real estate, it's about helping potential buyers envision a space as their own,
              while in architectural photography, it's the thrill of showcasing a building's design and aesthetic
              appeal.

              How do you handle lighting in architectural photography, especially for buildings with mixed lighting or
              lots of reflective surfaces?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Lighting can be a challenge in architectural photography. I often use bracketing and then blend the images
              in post-processing to handle mixed lighting. For reflective surfaces, I carefully consider the angle of my
              shot to minimize unwanted reflections.
